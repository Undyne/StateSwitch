#  StateSwitch

This is a simple toggle switch created for use in SwiftUI.  It consists of a RoundedRect background, with another RoundedRect underneath the chosen option.  Both Rects use dynamic sizing based on the text sizes of left and right options, with the chosen option rect changing sizes to match the text size with an appropriate border.

To use in your app, copy the StateSwitchView folder and use it by adding StateSwitchView() to your view stack
